proof of concept covid tracing plotted on a map, designed around the UMD campus

use case: determining courses/sections where transmission is most likely to have occurred, and send twilio notifiations if you are enrolled in that class

possibly work with course size as a determinant of transmission risk, large lectures can have a small radius around specific seats, others will just be whole class
